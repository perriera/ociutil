## How to clone your project with (perriera) ociutil template
> This is a basic step-by-step process whereby you can quickly setup a C++17 based project using CMake 3.21 (or above) including a properly setup changelog.md file (that will help you keep track of changes to your github.com repository).

 1. **GIVEN** we need to create a C++17 template with CMake 3.2.1
 2. **WHEN** we use (perriera) ociutil as that template
 3. **THEN** we can just make a few changes to have our C++ project

### Prerequisites
 1. Github.com account (or something similiar)
 2. Access to *(perriera) ociutil* 
 3. The ability to create a project from this template
 4. You are logged into your account
 5. You are running Linux (or a variant) 
 6. You have the git utility installed
 7. You have Visual Studio Code installed (or similar) 
 8. You have a SSH key added to your github.com account

### Wish Case
As you already using github.com it therefore perfectly logical for you to merely press the green NEW button to the left of your github.com page. 

 1. Go to your github.com account page 
 2. Press the green button entitled *New*
 3. Under *Repository template s*elect *perrier/ociutil*
 4. In the *Repository name* field enter the name of your project
 5. Optionally fill in the *Description* field
 6. Select *Public* or *Private*
 7. Check over the parameters (for accuracy)
 8. Press the green Create Repository button
 9. Now you will be shown your new project
 10. There should be a green Code button, click it
 11. Select the SSH tab (default)
 12. Copy the URL to the clipboard
 13. Open a Terminal box
 14. Make/create a general projects directory 
 15. (aka. `mkdir ~/Projects`)
 15. (aka. `cd ~/Projects`)
 16. Execute **git clone <url>** (paste the clipboard)
 17. cd into your project directory 
 18. (aka. `cd <project_name>`)
 19. Execute **code .** 
 20. Now you need to do a simple search and replace
 21. In Visual Studio Code top menu do  *Edit->Replace In Files*
 22. Highlight the *Aa* option as this is going to be case sensitive
 23. Replace *ociutil* with *<your_project_name>* (all lowercase)
 24. (You will see a small icon to the right of the replace field)
 25. Replace *OCIUTIL* with *<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>* (all caps)
 26. Click the replace icon again
 27. Replace *oci::* with *<your projects three letter acronym>* (lowercase)
 28. Click the replace icon again
 29. Replace *namespace oci* with *namespace <your projects three letter acronym>* (lowercase)
 30. Click the replace icon again
 31. Now click on the Visual Studio Code Explorer window 
 32. Open up the include directory
 33. Change *include/ociutil* directory name to your *include/<your_project_name>*
 34. Now build your project with a *Ctrl-B*

From here you have created a new project with the **(perriera) extras** template for C++17. 

### Alternate Case
#### In the case of not having a github.com account
 1. Goto Github.com 
 2. In the *Search Github* text box enter *ociutil*
 3. Scroll down until you see *perrier/ociutil*
 4. Click on  *perrier/ociutil*
 5. There should be a green Code button, click it
 6. Select the HTTPS tab (default)
 7. Copy the URL to the clipboard
 8. Open a Terminal box
 9. Make/create a projects directory
 10. Cd into that directory
 11. Execute **git clone <url>** (paste the clipboard)
 12. Execute **mv ociutil <name of your project>**
 13. Execute **code .** 

### Alternate Case
#### You downloaded the .zip file instead
 1. There should be a green *Code* button, click it
 2. Press the *Download ZIP* option
 3. In your *~/Downloads* folder you should see the zip
 4. Cut & Paste that to your projects directory
 5. Unzip the file 
 6. Open a Terminal box
 7. Make/create a projects directory
 8. Cd into that directory
 9. Execute **git clone <url>** (paste the clipboard)
 10. Execute **mv ociutil-dev <name of your project>**
 11. Execute **code .** 

### Alternate Case
#### You already have created a clone from the extras_cpp template
 1. There should be a green Code button, click it
 2. Select the SSH tab (default)
 3. Copy the URL to the clipboard
 4. Open a Terminal box
 5. Make/create a general projects directory 
 6. (aka. `mkdir ~/Projects`)
 7. (aka. `cd ~/Projects`)
 8. Execute **git clone <url>** (paste the clipboard)
 9. cd into your project directory 
 10. (aka. `cd <project_name>`)
 11. Execute **code .** 

### Summary 
Now you have both cloned the project as well as renamed everything to your projects name.
